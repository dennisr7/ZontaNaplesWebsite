              For more than a century, Zonta clubs around the world have united professionals and community
              leaders to advance the status of women through service and advocacy. The Zonta Club of Naples
              continues this legacy locally—supporting education, safety, health, and economic opportunity for
              women and girls.

              Zonta's centennial marked a milestone in collective action. From early literacy efforts to
              modern-day partnerships that address violence, inequality, and access to education, Zonta
              members have always paired compassion with practical impact. Our work scales from individual
              mentorship to policy engagement—meeting needs today while advocating for systemic change.

              Zonta's second century begins with the same conviction that launched the first: when women

              of leaders who will carry it forward.
